  <title>Praise &amp; Worship Summary</title>
  <subtitle/>
  <notes/>
  <slides>
  <slide>
  <body>Praise is an audible, literal praise to God... Jesus, You saved me. God, You healed me. Lord, You love me.  The Lord delivered me from sin.</body></slide>
  <slide>
  <body>Worship is a thought, feeling, or act of our love for Christ, often expressed as a sign of surrender... lifting hands, clapping (could also be praise, audible), dancing (also a form of praise, see Psa 149:6), bowing, running, jumping, etc.</body></slide>
  <slide>
  <body>Applying the literal definitions to these words changes the way the passages read, and how the actions are performed.  Regardless, both must be done from a point of honesty and vulnerability.</body></slide>
  <slide>
  <body>Praise is sacrifice (Jer 17:26, Heb 13:15, 2Ki 17:36).  Just like then, God may or may not show up for the sacrifice, but it still needs to be done.  Being a “Christian”, we should want and expect for the physical presence of the Creator to show up.</body></slide></slides></slide_group>

  <notes/>
  <slides>
  <slide>
  <body>Praise "...comes from the Latin pretium, "price," or "value," and may be defined generally as an ascription of value or worth. Praise may be bestowed upon unworthy objects or from improper motives, but true praise consists in a sincere acknowledgment of a real conviction of worth. Its type may be seen in the representation given in the Apocalypse of the adoration of God and of the Lamb, which is inspired by a sense of their worthiness to be adored (Re 4:11; 5:12)."</body></slide></slides></slide_group>

  <subtitle>Is there a need for praise?</subtitle>
  <notes/>
  <slides>
  <slide>
  <body>21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.</body></slide>
  <slide>
  <body>Note:  Even in battle the Lord's Prayer applies...  Praise and thanks start any battle.  They went singing before the army with praise!</body></slide>
  <slide>
  <body>22 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.</body></slide>
  <slide>
  <body>Note:  According to Gen 29:35... "And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing."</body></slide>
  <slide>
  <body>Hitchcock's Bible Names Dictionary defines Judah to mean "the praise of the Lord; confession".</body></slide>
  <slide>
  <body>When it says "which were come against Judah", it could easily be translated as "which were come against the praise of the Lord."</body></slide>

  <slide>
  <body>Notice "great shout"...  If we have ever shouted / jumped out of your seat / clapped your hands / hooted and hollered for a sports team and never done the same for the Creator / Christ, the Lord / Lord, God Almighty...  Repentance is called for.</body></slide></slides></slide_group>
